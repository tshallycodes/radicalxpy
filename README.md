# Gemini Model with Personalized Responses

Welcome to the Gemini Model project! This repository contains code and resources for a generative model that provides personalized responses. The model is built using [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).


## Introduction

The Gemini Model is designed to generate personalized responses based on user input. It leverages the power of AI to understand and respond in a contextually relevant manner. This project demonstrates how to integrate Vertex AI's generative models with a Streamlit application to create an interactive chat interface.

## Features

- **Generative Model Integration**: Uses Vertex AI for generating responses.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the model.
- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation history for personalized responses.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows customization of model parameters such as temperature.
